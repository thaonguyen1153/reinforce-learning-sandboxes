# Assignment 1
We continue to explore Reinforcement Learning by creating a Blocks World environment and 
training a variety of algorithms on the environment.  This will increase your familiarity with 
Gymnasium environments and Q-learning, as well as implementing and evaluating Stable-
Baselines3 algorithms on arbitrary environments.

### Environments

- `BlocksWorldEnv`: Simplistic implementation of blocksworld environment

## Installation

To install blocksworld environment, run the following commands:

```{shell}
cd bw-thaonguyen1153
pip install -e .
```

## Tips
1. Show matplot: set ```export QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1```
